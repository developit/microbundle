# TODO

- document why we forked it.
- keep in sync in the readme what version of microbundle we're in sync with (v0.12.3 at the time of the fork).
- document how it's intended to be used with eik, in the two target scenarios: 1) bundling a podlet. 2) bundling a library meant to be published to both an eik cdn and to npm.
